# Superhero App
Second Front End Skill Test

# Authentication method used
Client-side Authentication used in this project since we cannot host server side app on git-hub and hosting is must in skill test.

For client-side Aurthentication only public key is recquired,additionally we have to authorise refferer from the devloper account otherwise it would give 401:unauthorised.

Server-side Authentication is not used as it will require to public private key on github. which is not a good thing.
